# Project Structure Guide

This monorepo contains both backend and frontend applications, organized as follows:

- **Backend API**: [apps/api/src/app.ts](mdc:apps/api/src/app.ts) is the main entry point for the backend API. Related controllers, routers, and services are under [apps/api/src/](mdc:apps/api/src/).
- **Frontend Web**: [apps/web/app/layout.tsx](mdc:apps/web/app/layout.tsx) is the main layout for the Next.js frontend. Pages are under [apps/web/app/](mdc:apps/web/app/), and shared modules/components are in [apps/web/modules/](mdc:apps/web/modules/).
- **Packages**: Shared code (auth, db, schemas, types, ui, etc.) is in [packages/](mdc:packages/).
- **Scripts**: Utility scripts are in [scripts/](mdc:scripts/).

Refer to this rule for high-level navigation and entry points.
